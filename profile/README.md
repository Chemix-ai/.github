Chemix is using AI to develop breakthrough EV battery technologies. Today’s battery development is slow, labor-intensive, and expensive. With AI, Chemix can reduce development time by 10x. Chemix’s battery designs are compatible with existing Li-ion battery manufacturing capacity, enabling a seamless transition of customers’  battery R&D to volume production. 

Chemix’s mission is to accelerate the development of the most sustainable battery chemistry by first eliminating the use of cobalt, and ultimately the reliance on nickel and lithium, all without compromising vehicle performance. Based in Sunnyvale, CA, Chemix’s team comprises researchers and business leaders from Harvard, Stanford, UC Berkeley, and industry-leading battery and AI startups.
